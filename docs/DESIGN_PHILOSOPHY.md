# Design philosophy (On the Move, single view), for other recipes

Written 2026-09-30 for the agent building "Downstream" (a stream map recipe). This is what we settled on in On the Move after two rounds of device feedback and a design review. Read the actual files before copying anything; the file names below point at the code.

## 1. Framework native, nothing else

- Only TRMNL Framework classes: no inline styles, no custom CSS (the owner calls extras "Extrawürstl").
- Before using a class, check that it exists in the framework's `plugins.css`. We guessed `outline--strong` and `overflow--hidden`, and neither exists.
- What we found useful:
  - Arbitrary sizes are pre-generated: `w--[Ncqw]` and `h--[Ncqh]` for N from 0 to 100, including the `portrait:` and `lg:` variants. `.layout` is the size container, so `cqw`/`cqh` are relative to the view.
  - `aspect--1/1`, `image image--cover`, `bg--canvas outline`, `rounded--full`, `stretch`, `no-shrink`, `flex--col flex--bottom` (bottom-anchored columns).
  - Text sizes, including their `lg:` variants: `label`, `title`, `description`.
- There is no title bar in any view: all the space goes to content.

## 2. Design for shapes, not for view names

- Four views times OG and X times two orientations gives 16 frames, which reduce to three shapes:
  - a wide strip: the half horizontal views in landscape;
  - a tall strip: half vertical in portrait;
  - a box: everything else.
- One template per view handles all its shapes:
  - `portrait:` classes switch the arrangement for portrait;
  - `lg:` classes give the X more (larger type, extra elements).
- Breakpoints come from the device model, not from a width. The OG is `md` and the X is `lg`, in both orientations. The renderer adds these classes; TRMNL's preview adds them after load, so anything hidden at load must be able to appear later.
- Everything the layouts share goes in the Shared tab: `{% template %}` components and one script. TRMNL prepends Shared to every layout.
- The script must allow two instances on one screen, because a mashup can hold our plugin twice. So it looks elements up relative to their scope and assigns ids at run time; it never relies on fixed ids.

## 3. The single view, per size (what the owner approved)

- **Full.** The map fills the screen.
  - A text box sits bottom left: canvas background plus outline, with the photo on its left.
  - An edge pill ("Destination: X · 2,012 km away") points at the destination only when the destination is not visible. "Not visible" means off the map, or under the text box, with a 16 px margin. The pill is placed afresh on every map draw.
  - If the pill's spot would land on the text box, the pill stacks above the box instead.
- **Half horizontal.** Photo and text on the left, map on the right. In portrait: the map on top, then photo and text below.
- **Half vertical.** Map on top, then the text, then the photo filling the rest. With the photo setting off, the map takes that space.
- **Quadrant.** The map, plus one strip of text: place and date. The photo appears only on the X in landscape, where the strip has room.
- **Text order**, everywhere:
  1. name (small, bold);
  2. place and state as the headline;
  3. destination;
  4. one fact;
  5. the date of the data.
  The date is always shown, so the recipe never claims to be live.
- Larger type on the X (`lg:label--large`, `lg:title--large`, `lg:description--large`), where there is room.
- Optional parts degrade cleanly: the photo off, no destination or no name must leave a layout with no gaps.

## 4. Maps

- Use `TRMNLMaps` with the `outline` preset: the leanest preset that still has water. The owner found roads distracting.
- Integer zoom only. The framework dithers fills only at an integer zoom; without that, a 2-bit screen shows the sea white. This was confirmed on the owner's device.
- Draw lines and dots with `TRMNLMaps.route` / `TRMNLMaps.dot`, never HTML markers: markers vanished under the dither layer.
  - A dashed or grey second line disappears at 1 bit. The line ahead is the same ink, only thinner.
- Keep a text fallback in place, so a map that fails to draw still shows the words.
- Check the data itself, not only the drawing. Our "double line" came from a usual-route table stitched across two years; the dot and the lines disagreed.

## 5. Words and settings

- The Worker sends every word, in English and German; the templates contain none.
- Settings get friendly, marketing-style names and clear descriptions. A switch is a boolean, on by default where that is the better experience. An empty value, sent before the settings are first saved, counts as the default.

## 6. How we worked with the owner

The sequence was:
1. brainstorm ideas;
2. rough wireframes on a canvas, which the owner comments on;
3. rendered mock-ups (variant templates through the real framework with real data), from which the owner picks;
4. build;
5. render sweep;
6. device feedback.

- Small, dated commits, with before and after numbers.
- A mock-up is a real render, never a drawing, once the direction is set.

## 7. Verification

- A render check (`template/render-check.mjs`) renders in real Chromium:
  - against TRMNL's own `plugins.css`/`plugins.js` and MapLibre;
  - with payloads the Worker builds from real data;
  - with the smaller views placed inside a real mashup;
  - with the breakpoint class the renderer would add.
- It sweeps every view on every screen and case, and fails when:
  - a map on screen is not drawn;
  - any text is cut off;
  - a list overflows;
  - the pill is shown without being needed, or needed without being shown;
  - the wrong number of maps is on screen.
- It can also add the size class late, to mimic TRMNL's preview.
- A Liquid pitfall: `divided_by` floors integers in Ruby Liquid (TRMNL) but not in liquidjs (the render check). Use `modulo`.
- Say "not confirmed on a device" until the owner has seen it on one.

## For Downstream

- The stream is the "animal":
  - its current state (level, flow, trend) is the headline;
  - upstream and downstream take the place of "where it came from" and "where it is heading";
  - an off-screen gauge or confluence gets the edge pill.
- Start from the four single layouts above and swap the photo slot for whatever image Downstream has, if any.
- Keep the map lean (the `outline` preset, integer zoom).
- Always show the time of the last reading.
